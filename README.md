# Informations

The project has been built with tailwindcss and uses
- Postgresql
- Redis (for async jobs)
- Elastisearch (for searches)
- Minio (for assets storage)

## Dependencies
- `active storage` for assets storage on minio with S3 protocols
- `haml`
- `countries` gem (for i18n and more)
- `draper` for decorators
- `loaf` for breadcrumbs
- `pagy` for paginations
- `searchkick` for searchs with elasticsearch
- `gruf` for gRPC client/server
- `dotenv` for env load
- `faker` for fake data loadings
- `factory_bot` for test factories

Wines dataset has been fetched from https://github.com/rogerioxavier/X-Wines

The gRPC service is running by default on `0.0.0.0:50051`

It works along two other projects:

## Protos

https://github.com/wineskills/protos

A repository to store and share gRPC protos with the platform and the ruby-client repositories.

## Ruby client

https://github.com/wineskills/ruby-client

The ruby client is a gem ready to consume the API through gRPC.

The client has been deployed on Rubygems: https://rubygems.org/gems/wineskills

# Prerequisites

- Docker with composer
- Ruby 3.3.4
- Rails 7.2.0

# Start

## Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wineskills/platform
cd platform
docker compose up -d # wait 10s until elasticsearch is ready
rake db:prepare

./bin/dev
open "http://localhost:3000"
```

## Client

From the project sources:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wineskills/ruby-client
cd ruby-client
gem build wineskills.gemspec
gem install wineskills-0.1.0.gem

# Fetch all wines
GRPC_SERVICES_URL=127.0.0.1:50051 wineskills wines
```

From Rubygems: https://rubygems.org/gems/wineskills
```bash
gem install wineskills # CURRENT VERSION=0.1.1

# Fetch all wines
GRPC_SERVICES_URL=127.0.0.1:50051 wineskills wines

# Search wines
GRPC_SERVICES_URL=127.0.0.1:50051 wineskills search beef
```

# Tests

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wineskills/platform
cd platform
docker compose up -d # wait 10s until elasticsearch is ready

rails test
```
